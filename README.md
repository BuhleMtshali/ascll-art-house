# 🏠 ASCII Art House in Python

This mini Python program uses nested `for` loops to draw a cute little ASCII art house, complete with a roof, walls, and a base!

It's a beginner-friendly project designed to help understand:
- Nested loops
- String manipulation
- Printing patterns in a grid-like format

---

## 💡 What It Does

The script prints out a house made of asterisks (`*`) with:

- A triangle-shaped **roof**
- A rectangular **wall**
- A solid **base**

Perfect for learning control flow and nested loop logic!

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Roof
The roof is built using a pyramid of `*` symbols. Spaces are added to center-align the stars and form a triangle shape.

### 2. Walls
A fixed number of wall lines are printed using `*` at the edges and spaces in between.

### 3. Floor
A final solid line of `*` closes the house at the bottom.
